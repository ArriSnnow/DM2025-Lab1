    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook I will explore a text-based, document-based [dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html) using scientific computing tools such as Pandas and Numpy. In addition, several fundamental Data Mining concepts will be explored and explained in details, ranging from calculating distance measures to computing term frequency vectors. Coding examples, visualizations and demonstrations will be provided where necessary. Furthermore, additional exercises are provided after special topics. These exercises are geared towards testing the proficiency of students and motivate students to explore beyond the techniques covered in the notebook."

The dataset is called \"Twenty Newsgroups\", which means there are 20 categories of news articles available in the entire dataset. A short description of the dataset, provided by the authors, is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper “Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,” though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.*\n",

Keep in mind that the original dataset is not in this nice pretty format. That work is left to us. That is one of the tasks that will be covered in this notebook: how to convert raw data into convenient tabular formats using Pandas."

    "First, let us consider that our dataset has some *missing values* and we want to remove those values. In its current state our dataset has no missing values, but for practice sake we will add some records with missing values and then write some code to deal with these objects that contain missing values. You will see for yourself how easy it is to deal with missing values once you have your data transformed into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into coding, let us do a quick review of what we have learned in the Data Mining course. Specifically, let's review the methods used to deal with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common reasons for having missing values in datasets has to do with how the data was initially collected. A good example of this is when a patient comes into the ER room, the data is collected as quickly as possible and depending on the conditions of the patients, the personal data being collected is either incomplete or partially complete. In the former and latter cases, we are presented with a case of \"missing values\". Knowing that patients data is particularly critical and can be used by the health authorities to conduct some interesting analysis, we as the data miners are left with the tough task of deciding what to do with these missing and incomplete records. We need to deal with these records because they are definitely going to affect our analysis or learning algorithms. So what do we do? There are several ways to handle missing values, and some of the more effective ways are presented below (Note: You can reference the slides - Session 1 Handout for the additional information).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eliminate Data Objects** - Here we completely discard records once they contain some missing values. This is the easiest approach and the one we will be using in this notebook. The immediate drawback of going with this approach is that you lose some information, and in some cases too much of it. Now imagine that half of the records have at least one or more missing values. Here you are presented with the tough decision of quantity vs quality. In any event, this decision must be made carefully, hence the reason for emphasizing it here in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimate Missing Values** - Here we try to estimate the missing values based on some criteria. Although this approach may be proven to be effective, it is not always the case, especially when we are dealing with sensitive data, like **Gender** or **Names**. For fields like **Address**, there could be ways to obtain these missing addresses using some data aggregation technique or obtain the information directly from other databases or public data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignore the missing value during analysis** - Here we basically ignore the missing values and proceed with our analysis. Although this is the most naive way to handle missing values it may proof effective, especially when the missing values includes information that is not important to the analysis being conducted. But think about it for a while. Would you ignore missing values, especially when in this day and age it is difficult to obtain high quality datasets? Again, there are some tradeoffs, which we will talk about later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replace with all possible values** - As an efficient and responsible data miner, we sometimes just need to put in the hard hours of work and find ways to makes up for these missing values. This last option is a very wise option for cases where data is scarce (which is almost always) or when dealing with sensitive data. Imagine that our dataset has an **Age** field, which contains many missing values. Since **Age** is a continuous variable, it means that we can build a separate model for calculating the age for the incomplete records based on some rule-based approach or probabilistic approach.  "

As you will see above, and as we anticipated, our dataset looks clean and all values are present, since `isnull` returns **False** for all fields and records. But let us start to get our hands dirty and build a nice little function to check each of the records, column by column, and return a nice little message telling us the amount of missing records found. This excerice will also encourage us to explore other capabilities of pandas dataframes. In most cases, the build-in functions are good enough, but as you saw above when the entire table was printed, it is impossible to tell if there are missing records just by looking at preview of records manually, especially in cases where the dataset is huge. We want a more reliable way to achieve this. Let's get to it!"

    "### 4.2 Dealing with Duplicate Data\n",
    "Dealing with duplicate data is just as painful as dealing with missing data. The worst case is that you have duplicate data that has missing values. But let us not get carried away. Let us stick with the basics. As we have learned in our Data Mining course, duplicate data can occur because of many reasons. The majority of the times it has to do with how we store data or how we collect and merge data. For instance, we may have collected and stored a tweet, and a retweet of that same tweet as two different records; this results in a case of data duplication; the only difference being that one is the original tweet and the other the retweeted one. Here you will learn that dealing with duplicate data is not as challenging as missing values. But this also all depends on what you consider as duplicate data, i.e., this all depends on your criteria for what is considered as a duplicate record and also what type of data you are dealing with. For textual data, it may not be so trivial as it is for numerical values or images. Anyhow, let us look at some code on how to deal with duplicate records in our `X` dataframe."

So yes, all the `duplicated()` operation does is to check per records instead of per column. That is why the operation only returns one value instead of three values for each column. It appears that we don't have any duplicates since none of our records resulted in `True`. If we want to check for duplicates as we did above for some particular column, instead of all columns, we do something as shown below. As you may have noticed, in the case where we select some columns instead of checking by all columns, we are kind of lowering the criteria of what is considered as a duplicate record. So let us only check for duplicates by only checking the `text` attribute."

In fact, we have already done some sampling by just reducing the records we are using here in this notebook; remember that we are only using four categories from the all the 20 categories available. Let us get an idea on how to sample using pandas operations."

    "### 5.2 Feature Creation\n",
    "The other operation from the list above that we are going to practise on is the so-called feature creation. As the name suggests, in feature creation we are looking at creating new interesting and useful features from the original dataset; a feature which captures the most important information from the raw information we already have access to. In our `X` table, we would like to create some features from the `text` field, but we are still not sure what kind of features we want to create. We can think of an interesting problem we want to solve, or something we want to analyze from the data, or some questions we want to answer. This is one process to come up with features -- this process is usually called `feature engineering` in the data science community.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know what feature creation is so let us get real involved with our dataset and make it more interesting by adding some special features or attributes if you will. First, we are going to obtain the **unigrams** for each text. (Unigram is just a fancy word we use in Text Mining which stands for 'tokens' or 'individual words'.) Yes, we want to extract all the words found in each text and append it as a new feature to the pandas dataframe. The reason for extracting unigrams is not so clear yet, but we can start to think of obtaining some statistics about the articles we have: something like **word distribution** or **word frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into any further coding, we will also introduce a useful text mining library called [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/). The NLTK library is a natural language processing tool used for text mining tasks, so might as well we start to familiarize ourselves with it from now (It may come in handy for the final project!). In partcular, we are going to use the NLTK library to conduct tokenization because we are interested in splitting a sentence into its individual components, which we refer to as words, emojis, emails, etc. So let us go for it! We can call the `nltk` library as follows:\n",

    "PAMI (PAttern MIning) is a Python-based library designed to empower data scientists by providing the necessary tools to uncover hidden patterns within large datasets. Unlike other pattern mining libraries that are Java-based (such as WEKA and SPMF), PAMI caters specifically to the Python environment, making it more accessible for data scientists working with Big Data. The goal of PAMI is to streamline the process of discovering patterns that are often hidden within large datasets, offering a unified platform for applying various pattern mining techniques. In the library you can find a lot of implementations from current state-of-the-art algorithms, all of them cater to different type of data, they can be: transactional data, temporal data, utility data and some others. You can find more information in the following github: [PAMI](https://github.com/UdayLab/PAMI?tab=readme-ov-file). For the purpose of our lab we will be modeling our text data as a transactional type. So let's get into it.\n",

    "**Transactional Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to apply pattern mining techniques, we first need to convert our text data into transactional data. A transactional database is a set of transactions where each transaction consists of a unique identifier (TID) and a set of items. For instance, think of a transaction as a basket of items purchased by a customer, and the TID is like the receipt number. Each transaction could contain items such as \"apple\", \"banana\", and \"orange\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a transactional database:\n",
    "\n",
    "TID\tTransactions\n",
    "1\ta, b, c\n",
    "2\td, e\n",
    "3\ta, e, f\n",
    "\n",
    "In this structure:\n",
    "TID refers to the unique identifier of each transaction (often ignored by PAMI to save storage space).\n",
    "Items refer to the elements in each transaction, which could be either integers or strings (e.g., products, words, etc.).\n",
    "When preparing text data, we need to transform sentences or documents into a similar format, where each sentence or document becomes a transaction, and the words within it become the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequent Pattern Mining**\n",
    "\n",
    "After converting the text into a transactional format, we can then apply frequent pattern mining. This process identifies patterns or combinations of items that occur frequently across the dataset. For example, in text data, frequent patterns might be common word pairs or phrases that appear together across multiple documents. Important term to learn: **Minimum Support**: It refers to the minimum frequency that a transaction has to have to be considered a pattern in our scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "PAMI allows us to mine various types of patterns, but for the purpuse of this lab we will explore the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patterns Above Minimum Support:** These are all patterns that meet a specified minimum support threshold. The result set can be quite large as it includes all frequent patterns, making it ideal for comprehensive analysis but potentially complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximal Frequent Patterns:** These are the largest frequent patterns that cannot be extended by adding more items without reducing their frequency below the minimum support threshold. The result set is smaller and more concise, as it only includes the largest patterns, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-K Frequent Patterns:** These patterns represent the K most frequent patterns, regardless of the minimum support threshold. The result set is highly focused and concise, with a fixed number of patterns, making it ideal when prioritizing the most frequent patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "(image removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following steps, we will guide you through how to convert text data into transactional form and mine frequent patterns from it.\n"

However, very rare words or extremely common words (like stopwords: 'the,' 'in,' 'a,' 'of,' etc.) don’t usually give us much useful information. To improve our results, we can filter out these words.

    "\n",
    "When we set a minimum support threshold (minSup) for finding frequent patterns, we are looking for a good balance. We want to capture important patterns that show real connections in the data, but we also want to avoid too many unimportant patterns. For this dataset, we've chosen a minSup of 9. We have done this after observing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item Frequency**: The first graph shows that most items don't appear very often in transactions. There's a sharp drop in how frequently items appear, which means our data has many items that aren't used much.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Length**: The second graph shows that most transactions involve a small number of items. The most common transaction sizes are small, which matches our finding that the dataset does not group many items together often.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting minSup at 9, we focus on combinations of items that show up in these smaller, more common transactions. This level is low enough to include items that show up more than just a few times, but it's high enough to leave out patterns that don't appear often enough to be meaningful. This helps us keep our results clear and makes sure the patterns we find are useful and represent what's really happening in the dataset.\n",

    "Dimensionality reduction is a powerful technique for tackling the \"curse of dimensionality,\" which commonly arises due to data sparsity. This technique is not only beneficial for visualizing data more effectively but also simplifies the data by reducing the number of dimensions without losing significant information. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the additional notes provided.\n",

    "We will start with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, which is focused on finding a projection that captures the largest amount of variation in the data. PCA is excellent for linear dimensionality reduction and works well when dealing with Gaussian distributed data. However, its effectiveness diminishes with non-linear data structures.\n",

    "        - Great for identifying clusters in data.\n",
    "    - Cons:\n",
    "        - Computationally intensive, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "        - Sensitive to parameter settings and might require tuning (e.g., perplexity).\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**:\n",
    "    - Pros:\n",
    "        - Often faster than t-SNE and can handle larger datasets.\n",
    "        - Less sensitive to the choice of parameters compared to t-SNE.\n",
    "        - Preserves more of the global data structure while also revealing local structure.\n",
    "    - Cons:\n",
    "        - Results can still vary based on parameter settings and random seed.\n",
    "        - May require some experimentation to find the optimal settings for specific datasets.\n",

In the t-SNE graph we observe a more scattered distribution, but still intermixing with all the categories. And with the UMAP graph, the limits for the data seem pretty well defined, two categories seem to have some points well differentiated from the other classes, but most of them remain intermixed. The algorithms were applied to the raw frequencies and this is considered a very naive approach as some words are not really unique to a document. Only categorizing by word frequency is considered a \"bag of words\" approach. Later on in the course you will learn about different approaches on how to create better features from the term-vector matrix, such as term-frequency inverse document frequency so-called TF-IDF."

    "In this section we are going to discuss a very important pre-preprocessing technique used to transform the data, specifically categorical values, into a format that satisfies certain criteria required by particular algorithms. Given our current original dataset, we would like to transform one of the attributes, `category_name`, into four binary attributes. In other words, we are taking the category name and replacing it with a `n` asymmetric binary attributes. The logic behind this transformation is discussed in detail in the recommended Data Mining text book (please refer to it on page 58). People from the machine learning community also refer to this transformation as one-hot encoding, but as you may become aware later in the course, these concepts are all the same, we just have different prefrence on how we refer to the concepts. Let us take a look at what we want to achieve in code."

    "# 7. Data Classification\n",
    "Data classification is one of the most critical steps in the final stages of the data mining process. After uncovering patterns, trends, or insights from raw data, classification helps organize and label the data into predefined categories. This step is crucial in making the mined data actionable, as it allows for accurate predictions and decision-making. For example, in text mining, classification can be used to categorize documents based on their content, like classifying news articles into categories such as sports, politics, or technology.\n",
    "Among various classification techniques, the **Naive Bayes classifier** is a simple yet powerful algorithm commonly used for text classification tasks. Specifically, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is particularly suited for datasets where features are represented by term frequencies, such as a document-term matrix, like the one we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "    The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier works by assuming that the features (words or terms in text data) follow a multinomial distribution. In simple terms, it calculates the probability of a document belonging to a particular category based on the frequency of words in that document, assuming independence between words (the \"naive\" part of Naive Bayes). Despite this assumption, it often performs remarkably well for text data, especially when working with word count features. Now, when incorporating the binary matrix of patterns we have, it remains compatible because the binary values can be seen as a count of pattern occurrences (1 for present, 0 for absent). Although binary features are not true \"counts,\" the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier can still handle them without issue. For more information you can go to: [NB Classifier](https://hub.packtpub.com/implementing-3-naive-bayes-classifiers-in-scikit-learn/)\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes, for that we first choose how to split our data, in this case we will follow a typical **70/30 split for the training and test set**. Let's see a comparison of what we obtain when classifying our data without patterns vs our data with the patterns."

    "### Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "Another popular classification technique is the **Decision Tree classifier**. Decision Trees work by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions. Each node in the tree represents a feature, and each branch represents a decision rule. The leaves represent the final class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree:**\n",
    "    Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to visualize. They can handle both numerical and categorical data and do not require feature scaling. However, they can be prone to overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data. In text classification, Decision Trees can be used with document-term matrices or augmented feature sets, just like Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier on both the document-term matrix and the augmented data (with patterns), allowing us to compare its performance with the Naive Bayes model.\n",

    "We will implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes, for that we first choose how to split our data, in this case we will follow a typical **70/30 split for the training and test set**. Let's see a comparison of what we obtain when classifying our data without patterns vs our data with the patterns."

You should feel excited and proud because the process of Data Mining usually involves 70% preprocessing and 30% training learning models. You will learn this as you progress in the Data Mining course. I really feel that if you go through the exercises and challenge yourself, you are on your way to becoming a super Data Scientist.\n",

    "After completing this notebook you can do a lot with the results we have generated. You can train algorithms and models that are able to classify articles into certain categories and much more. You can also try to experiment with different datasets, or venture further into text analytics by using new deep learning techniques such as word2vec. All of this will be presented in the next lab session. Until then, go teach machines how to be intelligent to make the world a better place."
